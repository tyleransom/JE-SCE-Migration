Notes: Statistics are weighted using the weights provided by each survey. Standard deviation listed below continuous variables in parentheses. Minimum and maximum listed below continuous variables in brackets. ACS sample consists of household heads ages 18--96 to match the SCE age ranges. Income in both surveys is total household income from all sources. In the ACS, income is computed conditional on \$5,000--\$225,000 to match the SCE range. ACS migration distance uses PUMAs instead of counties. ACS urbanicity is computed only using households whose urbanicity is known. For further details, see Section \ref{sec:data}.}
